  // The game will consist of multiple rounds, until one player "crashes" 5 times.

  // A "crash" occurs when the head of one snake runs into any part of the body of
  // the competitor's snake. After a crash, the score of the player who did NOT crash
  // is augmented by the length of that player's snake. After a crash, both players
  // have their snakes reset to the original length.
  //
  // A player's snake is lengthened if he runs over "food", which appears randomly on
  // the screen. Whichever player gets to the food first will get their snake lengthened.
